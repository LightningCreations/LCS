This document is a working draft and proposal for LCS 1 - Definition of the Lightning Creations Specification Project, it does not constitute an agreed-upon document released by Lightning Creations, the Lightning Creations Specification Project, or the LCS Review Committee. Sections named as §_N_ are expected to appear in the final version. Sections named as D§_N_ are expected not to appear.


## D§1 Statement of Proposal

The proposal herein defines LCS, or Lightning Creations Specifications, and the LCS Project. It also defines the LCS Review committee, nominated members of Lightning Creations which are allowed to review LCS Drafts and accept or decline there publication as an LCS Documentation. This document does not define the review or acceptance process for the LCS Review Committee. 


## §1 Definition of the Project

The Lightning Creations Specification Project is a project which seeks to publish various specifications pertaining to Lightning Creations Projects. The Specifications are published by Lightning Creations and the LCS Review Committee on behalf of the author of that specification. These specifications will be assigned some number, and can be referred to as LCS followed by the number. For example, the 1st LCS can be referred to as LCS 1. Additionally, LCS Drafts may be done freely, and can be referred to as LCSD followed by the name of person who is writing the Draft, followed by the number that person chose to assign to it. This will be reviewed for publication according to a process layed out in a future LCS. This process is herein referred to as the "LCS Review Process", and will be carried out by nominated members of Lightning Creations, herein referred to as the "LCS Review Committee". The publication of an LCS is not a statement of endorsement of that LCS by either Lightning Creations or the LCS Review Committee. Neither Lightning Creations or the LCS Review Committee provides any warranties of any kind about Published LCS Documents, and may not be held liable for any damages caused, directly or indirectly, through the use of an LCS Document. 


## §2 Structure of an LCS Document

An LCS Document or LCS is formatted as a series of sections, where the _n_th section is indicated by a Heading labeled as §_n _followed by the given name of the section. Additionally, these sections may be divided into a series of subsections, subsections may be further subdivided, etc. There is no limit to the depth or number of these subdivisions. A subdivision, m levels deep, is labeled as §_n<sub>1</sub>_._n<sub>2</sub>_.(...)._n<sub>m</sub>_. Subdivisions of a section should be related to the level directly enclosing it. Further, sections of an LCS Document should be related to the Specification defined in it.

No sections in an LCS Document may be labeled as D§_n_. 

There is also a Title, which contains LCS, followed by the assigned LCS Number, then a Dash, then the chosen title for the specification. 

Following the title but before any sections, there is an indication of the publication date, given in the format mm-dd-yyyy, as well as a short copyright notice from the author of the Document. If a License Agreement, which is longer than a few sentences, is given, it is assigned its own section. There may also be an indication of any previous LCS Documents which are superseded by the LCS Document. This may indicate all superseded documents, or only the most recent, if that most recent one supersedes all the omitted LCS Documents. 


### §2.1 Structure of an LCS Draft

An LCS Draft, or LCSD is formatted similar to an LCS Document. In addition to the rules above, a Draft Section, labeled as D§_n_ may appear. These sections are part of the draft itself, rather than the specification, and are not expected to appear in the published LCS Document. Any Section labeled as §_n_ is expected to appear in the published LCS Document, and are called Standard Sections. If a Draft Section is changed to be expected to appear in the published LCS Document, a revision of the draft must be published with the Draft Section relabeled as a Standard Section. A subdivision of a Standard Section may be a Draft Section. In this case, the first layered subdivision which is not expected to appear in the published LCS Document has D prefix the number of that subdivision. The Standard Section at the previous layer is said to contain that Draft Section. It is impossible for a Draft Section to contain a Standard Section in this way. Instead of a publication date, a draft date is given. An LCS Draft which a later draft date then any other LCS Draft with the same number from the same author supersedes each of those LCS Drafts. 


### §2.2 Structure of this Publication

This Publication, referred to as LCS 1, is structured in the same manner as any LCS Document. This Publication shall be considered an LCS Document for purposes of review. Additionally, this document shall be considered an agreement between the nominated members of the LCS Review Committee. Acceptance of the position as a member of the LCS Review Committee constitutes acceptance of this agreement.


### §2.D3 Structure of this Draft

This Draft, referred to as LCSD Lightning Creations 1, is structured in a similar manner as any LCS Draft. It has no legal bearing, or any bearing outside of its role as an LCS Draft. Unlike other LCS Drafts, this LCS Draft is subject to review by Lightning Creations, rather than the LCS Review Committee. Upon Approval it will be assigned LCS 1, and published as is, with all Draft Sections Removed, and the Publication Date replacing the Draft Date.


## §3 LCS Review Committee

The LCS Review Committee is a voluntary position appointed by Lightning Creations. At the offering of a position on the LCS Review Committee, the member may decline or accept the position.  LCS Drafts may be subject to Independent Review by a member of the LCS Review Committee, possibly advised by one or more other members, or Committee Review by the entire LCS Review Committee. The process for Independent Review or Committee Review is not laid out in this Document, and will be defined by a later LCS.  Prior to publication, a final revision of the LCS Draft, structured as an LCS Document will be subject to Committee Review. Additionally, this publication will be subject to Committee Review a year from its publication date, and updated terms may be published as a new LCS Document which supersedes this one. The new LCS Document will then come into effect over this one. A separate LCS Document will be published will all active members of the LCS Review Committee.
