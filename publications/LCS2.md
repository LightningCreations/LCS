## §1 LCS Review Committee

The LCS Review Committee is a group tasked by Lightning Creations 
with the duty of Reviewing LCS Drafts to prepare them for publication,
and Reviewing Proposed LCS Documents before publishing them, as
defined by §3 of LCS 1.

This document defines the procedure which the LCS Review Committee shall use to review LCS Drafts and Documents.

### §1.1 Status of this Publication

This Publication, as LCS 2, shall be considered an LCS Document. It shall also be an agreement between all members of 
the LCS Review Committee. 

Annually, the LCS Review Committee shall subject this Publication to Committee Review (§2.2). 
A Revision of this LCS Document may then be published if changes are deemed necessary.


## §2 Review Processes

This document defines 2 standardised review processes for use in reviewing LCS Drafts and Documents. 
Under most circumstances, LCS Drafts and Documents should be reviewed using one of these methods, 
however, at the option of the LCS Review Committee, a separate process may be used for any given 
LCS Draft or Document.  

Each part of a Reviewed LCS Draft or Document should be considered as a whole, and individually in the context of the LCS Draft or Document. 
Each section of an LCS Draft or Document (Collectively "Reviewed Document") should be clear, 
well-structured, and related to the subject matter of the Reviewed Document. 
Additionally, each section of a Reviewed Document should not have grammatical errors,
 or other issues with the use of language. 
Judgements for the above fall to the Reviewer in the case of Individual Review, and the LCS Review Committee in the case
 of Committee Review. 

### §2.1 Individual Review

Any LCS Draft may be subjected to Individual Review. In such review of an LCS Draft, a member of the LCS Review Committee 
is elected to serve as the Reviewer. The Reviewer may request any number of additional members to act as Review Advisers, 
who will assist the Reviewer in the Individual Review. 

The Reviewer will consider the LCS Draft as a whole, and its parts individually in the context of the LCS Draft, 
and will either accept the LCS Draft, request it be updated with comments on portions which need to be fixed, 
or deny the LCS Draft. 

If the Draft is denied, then no further review will take place. 
The reviewer should provide detailed information as to the reasoning for the denial. 

If the Draft is accepted, the reviewer shall consult the LCS Review Committee to assign the Draft a Document Number. 
The Draft Author should then be requested to submit a "Final Revision", in the form of an LCS Document, with that assigned 
Document number. 
When received, the "Final Revision" shall be subject to Committee Review (defined below, §2.2), and if accepted, 
will be published AS-IS as an LCS Document. 

#### §2.1.1 Conflict of Interest

Members of the LCS Review Committee may submit LCS Drafts of there own. When an LCS Draft is subject to Individual Review, 
the Draft Author may not serve as the Reviewer. The Draft Author may serve as an advisor for the Reviewer. 
This is to prevent general bias in the Review process. 

### §2.2 Committee Review

LCS Drafts, and "Final Revisions" of LCS Documents may be subject to Committee Review. Rather than an elected individual, 
all members of the LCS Review Committee will Review the Draft or "Final Revision" as a group. 
The same considerations as with Individual Review shall be made towards any Draft or "Final Revision" in Committee Review. 
Whether or not a Draft or "Final Revision" is accepted, denied, or revisions are requested, is decided by a Majority vote 
of the LCS Review Committee. 
In the event of a tie for majority, precedence will be given to Revision Requests, then Denial, then Acceptance. 

### §2.3 Review of LCS 1, LCS 2, and all other special LCS Documents

Some Special LCS Documents are subject, by a self-contained clause, to Annual Committee Review. 
The Review of such LCS Documents cannot be denied, only accepted AS-IS, or revisions requested. 
When Revisions of such an LCS Document are requested, a member of the LCS Review Committee is elected 
to author, on behalf of Lightning Creations, a Draft which revises the LCS Document in question. 

These Revisions shall then be subject to Committee Review, and when accepted, 
the Revisions shall be published. The "Final Revision" process is skipped for such Drafts. 

### §2.4 Drafts Authored on behalf of Lightning Creations

Members of Lightning Creations may Author LCS Drafts of behalf of Lightning Creations. These Drafts shall be reviewed 
with strict scrutiny. For purposes of Review, the Author of that Draft may be considered the Member or Members 
of Lightning Creations whom submitted the LCS Draft. 

Additionally, LCS Drafts Authored on behalf of Lightning Creations shall be reviewed specially for the purposes of determining 
the necessity of scope. If it is determined that the draft's subject matter or content does not warrant publication from 
Lightning Creations, it shall be denied. Resubmissions of the draft may be accepted if made from the original Author. 

LCS Drafts revising Special LCS Documents pursuant to §2.3 shall be exempted from these rules.
