# LCS 5 - LCS OID Allocation

Published By: Lightning Creations

Draft Date: 2020-01-22

# ยง1 OID Allocation

The OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.54569.1 shall be known as the Lightning Creations OID. 
This allocation is perpetual and irrevocable subject to private terms. 

Through the LCS Project, Lightning Creations may authorize subordinate OIDs be allocated from this OID,
 with allocation requirements not herein specified. 
 
## ยง1.1 LCS Project OID Allocation

The LCS Project shall be allocated a subordinate OID, 1.3.6.1.4.1.54569.1.1. This subordinate is allocated 
 by the LCS Review Committee, such that all published LCS Documents are assigned the Document OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.54569.1.1.*n*,
 where n is the LCS Document's LCS Number. The LCS Document may allocate subordinates from this OID as it specifies. 
 A final revision LCS Document may use its expected Document OID (derived from its expected LCS Number),
 rather than its assigned Document OID. 
 A draft not submitted for final review Shall indicate its use of the Document OID by replacing *n* with {...},
 or by simply using the prefix {...} followed by the subordinate chain. 
 
Whether or not an LCS Document uses its Document OID, the allocation is made. No LCS Document may use the Document OID
 of another LCS Document or the expected Document OID of any final revision LCS Document (unless and until that Document is denied).
